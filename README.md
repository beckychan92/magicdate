The goal of this program is to 1.) ask the user to input a date and 2.) and determine whether that date is considered magic or not.

Shortly after the program is executed, the program will ask the user to input the month, date and year. If the date is not within range such as 02/31/99 (as there's only 28 days for February), the program will request the user to update either the month or date that was incorrectly inputted.

Magic in this program is determined by the following formula: month times (x) date equals (=) year. For example 06/10/60 will be considered as "magic" as the month (06) times the date (10) equals to the year (60). However, it will not work for dates such as 09/18/10 where the multiplication of month (09) and date (18) does not equal to the year (10).

Once the status (magic or not magic) is determined, the status will then be displayed in the screen and the program will terminate.

Please note, for simplicity, we will assume that there are no such thing as leap year so February 29th does not exist in the current program.
